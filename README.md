### Hi there 👋

🚀 About Me

🎓 I am Sumit Satyam, a Cross Platform Developer (specializing in Front End Web Development). I am currently pursuing my Masters' in Computer Applications. 

🤵 I am really enthusiastic about learning new technologies. I learnt HTML, CSS, JS, SQL. I am currently learning MERN & ASP.NET MVC. I also got started with blogging and youtube.

🎸 Outside the world of tech too, I love pushing myself to develop new skills ranging from Guitar, sketching & touch typing. 

📙 I love reading books on Personal Development & Financial literacy. My favourite ones are The Alchemist by Paulo Coelho, The 48 Laws Of Power by Robert Greene, How To Stop Worrying And Start Living by Dale Carnegie in the genre of personal development & Rich Dad Poor Dad by Robert T. Kiyosaki and Sharon Lechter in the genre of Financial literacy.

✈️ I love travelling as well, even though its been some time since I last travelled. My last trip was a solo trip to Varanasi & Pondicherry.
